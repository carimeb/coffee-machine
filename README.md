# A coffee machine programmed in Kotlin

Source: https://hyperskill.org/projects/33

## About
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

## Learning outcomes
This project allows you to get a taste of Kotlin. Practice working with classes, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Java.

## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn

### 1/6: Making coffee 
  Write a program that puts some basic information on the screen: let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee.
  
  
### 2/6: Ingredient calculator
  Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.


### 3/6: Estimate the number of servings
  Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.


### 4/6: Buy, fill, take!
  Teach your virtual coffee machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.


### 5/6: Keep track of the supplies
  Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.


### 6/6: Brush up your code
  Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
